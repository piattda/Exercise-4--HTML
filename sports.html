    <h1>OSU Club Swim!</h1>
    <p>Ohio State's Club Swim (CSOSU) is my favorite sports team.
      I swam with them for 3 years and had a blast.
      They pushed me to be my best and achieve all that I could.
      CSOSU is a dedicated and motivated group of students who all
      work together to show every other club swim in the country that
      Ohio State has the best club swim team.
